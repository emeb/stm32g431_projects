# Images
This directory contains images and code to support creating texture files
used by the raycasting demo

## prerequisites
To build this you will need the following tools

* C compiler for your host
* make
* ffmpeg version 4.1.5 or newer (for texture mangling)

## Building

	git clone https://github.com/emeb/stm32g431_projects.git
	cd stm32g431_projects/images
	make

This should build the converter tool and create the textures.h file needed
by the lcd project

## Image content

These images are all created by Eric Brombaugh from photographs taken
personally, or hand-drawn in GIMP.
